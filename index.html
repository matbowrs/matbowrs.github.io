                        My name is Matthew Bowers and welcome to my personal site. This site is used mostly to
                        showcase my experience, my skills, and things I am learning, or working on. In the future, 
                        it may become more of a personal blog-style platform where I write about things that interest
                        me for my own sake and to act as though I am teaching someone something, which I find is a great
                        method to confirm your understanding and also find knowledge gaps.

                        <h3>AWS Solutions Architect - Associate</h3>
                        <p>I was introduced to cloud infrastructure during my time at ADP. I thought it was very overwhelming at first; there are so many
                            services. Little by little, I learned and familiarized myself with the core services AWS provides and I grew to really enjoy it.
                            At some point in my career, I want to have the opportunity to design and architect my own solutions for companies. This certificate
                            would help me move towards that goal.

                        <p>
                            This is an awesome book and introduction to LLMs. I've learned a lot about how LLMs process text, which I find 
                            extremely interesting. How text gets tokenized and how those tokens are turned into embeddings and how those embeddings store
                            so much information in them has been awesome to learn about. I'm really enjoying this book and currently reading about
                            text clustering and topic modeling.

                        <p>
                            I've been wanting to learn more about AI agents and how they work. This course has been a great introduction to the
                            topic and I've learned a lot about how to use the Hugging Face API to create and use agents. The potential use cases for agents
                            is really endless and exciting. I felt like I gave my agent a super power when I specified which tool it could use to answer
                            questions.

                            there is German. This is hard to quantify, but I'm around A2 level and working my way through one of my all-time favorite
                            language learning resources, Assimil.

                        <p>I've been wanting to learn Golang for awhile now. Tools that I use (or have used) like Kubernetes, are written in it,
                            and the client/server stuff is very easy to write and I've wanted to try my hand at that. It's also a useful Cloud/DevOps
                            language in general and it would be a good addition to my programing language arsenal.

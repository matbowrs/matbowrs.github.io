                        <p>I was introduced to cloud infrastructure during my time at ADP. I thought it was very overwhelming at first; there are so many
                            services. Little by little, I learned and familiarized myself with the core services AWS provides and I grew to really enjoy it.
                            At some point in my career, I want to have the opportunity to design and architect my own solutions for companies. This certificate
                            would help me move towards that goal.

                            and the client/server stuff is very easy to write and I've wanted to try my hand at that. It's also a useful Cloud/DevOps
                            language in general and it would be a good addition to my programing language arsenal.
